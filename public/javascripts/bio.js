    "I studied fine art in university, which was really cool. I got to do lithography printmaking, which is where you draw your image onto a flat, rectangular stone, and then you roll it up with ink and press paper against it to make copies.",
    "It's really hard to get access to that equipment though, so after university, I learned to do digital art, which is kind of like lithography but you make a digital file instead of a stone 🙂 If that makes any sense 😅",
    "I started learning to program, but it was just for fun because I couldn't think of anything I would want to build with it.",
    `Then I read "I Am Malala", and I was so sad to think that there was nothing I could do to help people. Art is important, but I wanted to do more to help people access education.`,
    "And then I realized you can do that with software! After all, I had learned digital art on my own after school, but I was able to do it because I had all these wonderful people on the internet to help me.",

It's such a huge part of ours lives, and when it's hard, stressful, and time-consuming, it becomes hard to do basic things. Even if a person is "just" ordering a pizza or chatting with a friend, having access to that software and having it work well is super important to that person at that time.`,

I did some rapid prototyping for internet-of-things startups like Moti, which was developing a physical object that would remind you when you needed to perform a task in order to keep developing your habit.",
        "Then I went to work for Khan Academy, where I got to work on edtech. This was really exciting because, as I mentioned, that's why I got into programming to begin with. And Malala even visited the office once! I was so excited 😍",
        "While I was there, I worked on A/B experiemnts, mostly on the logged out homepage, did some more prototyping for a new, cohesive design system that would could be update the brand and also help us develop new features faster.",
        "I also did a lot of work on accessibility generally. We needed to bring the core product up to a certain level of accessibility (AA), but none of those features had originally been developed with accessibility in mind 😥 It was really nice to see the product improve so much in this area once we put a concerted effort into it. And of course, I learned a ton.",
